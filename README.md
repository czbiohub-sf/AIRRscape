# AIRRscape
R Shiny tool to visualize antibody lists or repertoires

The code is currently in 2 components: airrscape_preprocessing.R & app.R.
The first R script is used to prepare the datasets used in the Shiny Tool.
The second script is the Shiny Tool application itself, and is in the shinyapp folder, along with the processed input files. When running in RStudio, running this script will open a web browser with the full Shiny experience.
