# AIRscape
R Shiny tool to visualize antibody lists or repertoires

The code is currently in 2 components: repertoire_visualizations.R & app.R
The first R script is used to modify the datasets used in the Shiny Tool
The second script is the Shiny Tool application itsself. When running in RStudio, running this script will open a web browser with the full Shiny experience.
