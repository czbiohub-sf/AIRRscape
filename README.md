# R Shiny tool to visualize antibody sequences or repertoires  

## Dependencies 
Have RStudio downloaded. https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Running the Shiny tool
To run the shiny tool, clone the repo and run the app.R file in your RStudio.

The code is currently in 2 components: airrscape_preprocessing.R & app.R. The first R script is used to prepare the datasets used in the Shiny Tool. The second script is the Shiny Tool application itself, and is in the shinyapp folder, along with the processed input files. When running in RStudio, running this script will open a web browser with the full Shiny experience.
